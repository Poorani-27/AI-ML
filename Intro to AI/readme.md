## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. It involves the development of computer systems capable of solving problems that require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and language translation.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It has various applications like pattern recognition, predictive analysis, and data mining.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks to learn intricate datasets. It has been successfully applied in areas like image and speech recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers to understand human language. It involves algorithms and models used in speech recognition, sentiment analysis, language translation, and text summarization.

## Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a field of AI that focuses on interpreting and understanding visual images or videos. It involves the development of algorithms for tasks like object recognition, image classification, segmentation, and facial recognition.
