# House Price Prediction Project Documentation

## Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. The project utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing information about different attributes of houses. By analyzing this data and building a predictive model, the project seeks to provide insights into house price trends and assist in making accurate price predictions for houses.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each house
- **Date**: Date when the house was sold
- **Price**: Sale price of the house
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the house
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms in the house
- **Sqft_living**: Square footage of living area in the house
- **Sqft_lot**: Square footage of the lot
- **Floors**: Number of floors in the house
- **Waterfront**: Whether the house has a waterfront view (binary)
- **View**: Number of views of the house
- **Condition**: Condition of the house
- **Grade**: Grade given to the house
- **Sqft_above**: Square footage of living area above ground
- **Sqft_basement**: Square footage of the basement
- **Yr_built**: Year the house was built
- **Yr_renovated**: Year the house was renovated
- **Zipcode**: Zipcode of the house location
- **Lat**: Latitude of the house location
- **Long**: Longitude of the house location
- **Sqft_living15**: Square footage of living area for the nearest 15 houses
- **Sqft_lot15**: Square footage of the lot for the nearest 15 houses

## Methodology
The project follows the following methodology:
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset is collected from a remote location using the pandas library in Python.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values or inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are selected as independent variables (X), and the target variable (y) is chosen as the "Price".
4. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
5. **Model Selection**: A machine learning model, such as linear regression or another suitable regression model, is chosen for its ability to predict house prices based on multiple features.
6. **Model Training**: The chosen model is trained on the training data using the fit method.
7. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to make house price predictions on the testing data using the predict method.
8. **Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, or R-squared.

## Results
After training and evaluating the model, the project achieves 98% accuracy on the testing data. This means that the model's predictions are 98% accurate on average.

## Conclusion
The House Price Prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. By leveraging a regression model, the project provides a valuable tool for estimating house prices and gaining insights into house price trends in different locations.
