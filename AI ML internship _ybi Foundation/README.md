# YBI Internship Program - AI and ML

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the YBI foundations internship program! This repository serves as a record of my journey as an AI and ML Intern, where I am learning and working on various projects related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.



## Internship Projects
This repository contains the projects I am working on during the internship program. Each project folder includes code, data, documentation, and any other resources related to the project.

##### 01.salary prediction 

Marking the beginning of my journey as an ML/AI developer. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the basics of machine learning and the various types of machine learning algorithms. In particular, I focused on supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data. The linear regression model, a cornerstone of supervised learning, became the focal point of my exploration. By selecting and training a linear regression model using both training and testing data, I honed my skills in model development and evaluation. Through this iterative process, I gained practical experience in model selection, training, and evaluation, culminating in the achievement of an impressive 95% accuracy rate.

##### 02.house price prediction
After completing the salary prediction project, I ventured into another project focused on house price prediction. This project introduced me to multiple linear regression models, which allowed me to predict house prices based on various attributes of the houses. By leveraging supervised learning principles, I trained and evaluated a multiple linear regression model, enhancing my skills in model development and data analysis. This project further enriched my understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.

#####  03. Diabetes Prediction
For my third project, I worked on predicting diabetes using machine learning algorithms. I started by preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, I experimented with different classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in classification tasks, model evaluation, and selecting the appropriate algorithms for specific problem domains.
