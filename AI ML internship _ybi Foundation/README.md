# YBI Internship Program - AI and ML

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the YBI foundations internship program! This repository serves as a record of my journey as an AI and ML Intern, where I am learning and working on various projects related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Internship Projects
This repository contains the projects I am working on during the internship program. Each project folder includes code, data, documentation, and any other resources related to the project.

1. **Salary Prediction**
   - Marking the beginning of my journey as an ML/AI developer. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the basics of machine learning and the various types of machine learning algorithms. In particular, I focused on supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data. The linear regression model, a cornerstone of supervised learning, became the focal point of my exploration. By selecting and training a linear regression model using both training and testing data, I honed my skills in model development and evaluation. Through this iterative process, I gained practical experience in model selection, training, and evaluation, culminating in the achievement of an impressive 95% accuracy rate. [Day09--Project link]

2. **House Price Prediction**
   - After completing the salary prediction project, I ventured into another project focused on house price prediction. This project introduced me to multiple linear regression models, which allowed me to predict house prices based on various attributes of the houses. By leveraging supervised learning principles, I trained and evaluated a multiple linear regression model, enhancing my skills in model development and data analysis. This project further enriched my understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios. [Day09--project link]

3. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - For my third project, I worked on predicting diabetes using machine learning algorithms. I started by preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, I experimented with different classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in classification tasks, model evaluation, and selecting the appropriate algorithms for specific problem domains. [Day10--project link]

4. **Admission Chance Prediction**
   - In this project, I focused on predicting admission chances for students based on various factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience. I used a Linear Regression model to predict admission chances and evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared Score. The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.81, indicating a good fit to the data. Additionally, I visualized the predicted versus actual values to assess the model's predictive performance.

5. **Fish Weight Prediction**
   - This project involves predicting the weight of fishes based on features such as category, height, width, and various length dimensions. I utilized a Linear Regression model for prediction and evaluated its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared Score. The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.82, indicating a good fit to the data. Additionally, I visualized the predicted versus actual values to assess the model's predictive performance.

6. **Credit Default Prediction**
   - In this project, I focused on predicting credit default using logistic regression. Features such as income, age, loan amount, and loan-to-income ratio were used to predict whether a customer would default on their loan. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 89.8% on the test set. Additionally, a confusion matrix and classification report were generated to evaluate the model's performance further.

7. **Movie Recommendation**
   - The objective of creating a movie recommendation system using visual learning is to enhance recommendation accuracy, increase user engagement, address the cold start problem, explore movie content, and provide personalized and diverse recommendations by analyzing visual features from movie posters, trailers, or frames. The project utilizes a dataset containing movie attributes such as genre, keywords, cast, director, budget, popularity, revenue, and more. Through text preprocessing and cosine similarity, the model generates personalized movie recommendations based on user input and similarity scores between movies. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) can be utilized to assess the quality of recommendations. [Code link]
